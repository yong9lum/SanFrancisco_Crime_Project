# San Francisco Crime Project - For a Safer City

With a crime rate of 64 per one thousand residents, San Francisco has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to other communities of various sizes — from the smallest towns to the very largest cities. One's chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime in San Francisco is 1-in-16, & within California alone, more than 99% of the communities have a lower crime rate. A victim of crime may experience different kinds of effects, including physical effects like injuries, psychological effects like anger & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), & economic effects like paying for medical expenses & time-off from work. The implications of crime go beyond individuals and affect communities as a whole. In San Francisco, property & low-level crimes are aggravating the destruction of the retail market. With rampant theft & lack of security, landmark Mission District stores are closing, while mom-&-pop businesses find it hard to survive when wracked by constant thefts. The high crime rates & lack of security has also resulted in San Francisco being labelled as a non-viable market, discouraging new businesses from setting up due to fear. Against high crime rates, every individual, family, community, and organization is a victim.

This project seeks to focus on the 3 most important outcomes that the stakeholders such as the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) & the local government can achieve, by taking action on insights derived from an analysis of past crime history:

1. Better Manpower Allocation & Scheduling
This will be done by analysing the geographical location & time distribution of past crimes through Tableau visualisations. Understanding the distributions of the incidents across San Francisco, manpower can be allocated more effectively — both within & across police departments — to enhance operations.

2. Preventive Patrol & Crime Allocation
This will be done by using XGBoosting to determine which patrol routes should be frequented at which timeslots to act as a deterrent for crime. CART & Logistic Regression will also be used to score the crime cases, to prioritise crimes that are more likely to be solvable to maximise investigators' time & effort.

3. Juvenile Protection
Tableau visualisations & time-series forecasting will be used to predict the trend of such crimes, so that more preventive actions could be taken to prevent these instances through better education in school or in the media.

In hindsight, additional variables such as weather & temperature could be taken into consideration to empower the SFPD with information to be more effective in preventing & solving crimes.
